코스코 전기자전거 Jetson Bolt Pro에 대해 알아보자

The Ultimate Compact E-bike
Ride a little higher with 14” wheels that stop on a dime with Dual Disc Brakes. The familiar design now sports a 350 watt rear wheel motor, and a bigger battery for more power. The extended frame geometry centers the rider, for better balance and agility. LED Headlight and a Detachable Red Strobing Rear Light come in the box and power on when you need it to. Lean back and hit the Cruise Control for those laid back rides.
