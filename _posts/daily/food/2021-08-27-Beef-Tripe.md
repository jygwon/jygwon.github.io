Beef Tripe

Tripe comes from the stomach lining of beef. There is also tripe from pork and sheep but beef tripe is the most common type.

The stomach of a cow has four chambers. Tripe can be from either of the first three chambers. Honeycomb tripe comes from the second stomach chamber. Its name alludes to the honeycomb pattern on the inside of the tripe. Because honeycomb tripe has the best flavor and is the most tender, it is the favored tripe for cooking. The flat, plain and smooth blanket tripe from the first stomach, and the bible or book tripe from the third stomach are less desirable.
